The day part is 45, which is also impossible since days can't exceed 31, and even that depends on the month. So both the month and day are invalid.

Even though the error message says \"valid date format\", the actual issue is the semantic correctness of the date components. \n\nI should structure the JSON response with an explanation that clearly points out the date column's invalid values.
