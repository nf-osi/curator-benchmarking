The input data has a \"grid_structure\" which is a JSON string. First, I need to parse that JSON to get the actual columns array.\n\nLooking at the grid_structure value, it's a string that represents a JSON object with a \"columns\" key. Each element in the columns array has a \"name\" and \"type\". So my task is to extract all the \"name\" values from each column in the order they appear.\n\nLet me parse the grid_structure. The outer JSON is in the input data, so I need to first parse the input JSON. Then, take the grid_structure string and parse that as well. Once parsed, the columns array is accessible. Then, iterate over each column object and collect the \"name\" fields.\n\nWait, the input data's grid_structure is a string, so I need to parse it into a JSON object. For example, in Python, using json.loads on that string would give the actual structure. Then, accessing the 'columns' key gives the list of column definitions. Each column has a 'name' key. So collect all those names in order.\n\nSo the steps are: parse the input JSON, parse the grid_structure string into a JSON object, extract the columns array, loop through each column, get the 'name' value, and compile them into a list in order.\n\nChecking the example input: the grid_structure has columns id, name, value. So the output should be [\"id\", \"name\", \"value\"].\n\nI need to make sure that the order is preserved as they appear in the columns array. Also, ensure that there are no typos in the names. The final JSON should have a \"columns\" key with the array of names.\n\nNo other processing is needed. Just extract the names. The types are not required here. The question is only about the column names. So the answer should be straightforward.\n",

First, I need to parse that JSON to get the actual columns array.\n\nLooking at the grid_structure value, it's a string that represents a JSON object with a \"columns\" key. Each element in the columns array has a \"name\" and \"type\". So my task is to extract all the \"name\" values from each column in the order they appear.\n\nLet me parse the grid_structure. The outer JSON is in the input data, so I need to first parse the input JSON. Then, take the grid_structure string and parse that as well. Once parsed, the columns array is accessible. Then, iterate over each column object and collect the \"name\" fields.\n\nWait, the input data's grid_structure is a string, so I need to parse it into a JSON object. For example, in Python, using json.loads on that string would give the actual structure. Then, accessing the 'columns' key gives the list of column definitions. Each column has a 'name' key. So collect all those names in order.\n\nSo the steps are: parse the input JSON, parse the grid_structure string into a JSON object, extract the columns array, loop through each column, get the 'name' value, and compile them into a list in order.\n\nChecking the example input: the grid_structure has columns id, name, value. So the output should be [\"id\", \"name\", \"value\"].\n\nI need to make sure that the order is preserved as they appear in the columns array. Also, ensure that there are no typos in the names. The final JSON should have a \"columns\" key with the array of names.\n\nNo other processing is needed. Just extract the names. The types are not required here. The question is only about the column names. So the answer should be straightforward.\n"

First, I need to parse that JSON string to get the actual columns array.\n\nLooking at the grid_structure value, it's a string that represents a JSON object with a \"columns\" key. Each element in the columns array has a \"name\" field. So my task is to extract all the \"name\" values from each object in the columns array and list them in the order they appear.\n\nLet me parse the grid_structure. The outer quotes are escaped, so when parsed, it should become a valid JSON object. The columns array has four objects: subject, treatment, outcome, and score. Each has a name and type. So the column names are those four, in that order.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON output matches the required structure: a JSON object with a \"columns\" array containing the names. No extra fields, just the list in order. Let me double-check that I didn't miss any columns or mix up the order. The order is subject, treatment, outcome, score. Yep, that's correct. So the final answer should be a JSON with those names in the array.\n",
