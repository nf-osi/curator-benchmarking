Without more context, \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" seems like a reasonable narrowing.\n\n2. **Assay**: The term \"spectroscopy\" is broad and has several specific types listed in the enum values for \"assay\". \"FTIR spectroscopy\" is a specific type of spectroscopy. Therefore, we can narrow \"spectroscopy\" down to \"FTIR spectroscopy\".\n\n3. **TumorType**: The term \"unknown\" is already present in the enum values for \"tumorType\". Therefore, no change is needed here.\n\nGiven these considerations, the corrected metadata in JSON format would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"diagnosis\": \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\",\n  \"assay\": \"FTIR spectroscopy\",\n  \"tumorType\": \"Unknown\"\n}\n```\n\nThis correction uses the exact controlled terminology values from the Target Schema, ensuring that the values match one of the exact enum values specified for each field."
