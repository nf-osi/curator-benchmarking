The general term here would be \"conventional MRI\" since that's the standard term provided.\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"unknown - no information available\".

The general term here would be \"conventional MRI\" since that's the standard term provided.\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"unknown - no information available\".

Looking at the Target Schema's diagnosis enum, the closest match seems to be \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". But wait, \"peripheral type\" might refer to a different type. However, the schema doesn't have a \"peripheral type\" option. The available options are \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\", \"Noonan Syndrome\", etc. Since \"peripheral type\" isn't listed, maybe \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" is the best fit here, assuming that's the standard term.\n\nNext, the assay is \"wide bore MRI\". The Target Schema's assay enum includes various MRI types like \"conventional MRI\", \"functional MRI\", etc. \"Wide bore\" isn't a listed term. The general term here would be \"conventional MRI\" since it's a standard type unless there's a more specific match. The schema doesn't have \"wide bore\", so \"conventional MRI\" is the safest choice.\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"no clear diagnosis\".

The Target Schema's diagnosis enum includes \"Vestibular Schwannoma\" and \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\", but \"acoustic neurofibromatosis\" isn't listed.

The Target Schema's assay enum has \"RNA-seq\" as an option. The additional detail about ribosomal RNA depletion is a specific protocol, so the broader term here is just \"RNA-seq\".\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"Acoustic neuroma of left vestibular nerve\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum includes \"Schwannoma\". Since \"acoustic neuroma\" is a type of schwannoma, especially vestibular, but the schema doesn't have \"Vestibular Schwannoma\" under tumorType. Wait, checking the tumorType enum again: \"Schwannoma\" is present. So \"Acoustic neuroma\" should be mapped to \"Schwannoma\".\n\nSo the corrected entries would be:\n\nDiagnosis: NF2-related schwannomatosis\n\nAssay: RNA-seq\n\nTumorType: Schwannoma\n",
