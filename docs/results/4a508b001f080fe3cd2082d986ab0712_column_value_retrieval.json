The input data includes a row_data JSON string and a column name. My task is to parse that, find the right column, and return its value in the specified JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the row_data. The row_data is a string that represents a JSON object. So I'll need to parse that string into a JSON object. The row_data has a \"columns\" field, which is another JSON object containing the actual columns and their values. The column name provided is \"assay\", so I need to look into the columns object and find the value associated with \"assay\".\n\nLooking at the example input, the row_data's columns are {\"sample_id\": \"S123\", \"assay\": \"RNA-seq\", \"tumor_type\": \"GBM\"}. The column_name is \"assay\", so the value should be \"RNA-seq\". \n\nI need to make sure that the value is returned correctly based on its type. In this case, \"RNA-seq\" is a string, so the JSON value should be a string. If the value was a number, like 123, it should be a number in the output. If it's null, then return null.\n\nSo the steps are: parse the row_data string into a JSON object, navigate to the columns section, retrieve the value for the given column_name, and then format the response as specified. The final JSON should have a \"value\" key with the extracted value. \n\nI should also check for possible errors, like if the column doesn't exist in the row_data. But according to the problem statement, maybe we can assume that the column exists. However, the problem says if the value is null, return null. So if the column exists but the value is null, handle that. But if the column doesn't exist, maybe that's an error, but the problem doesn't specify. The example given has the column present, so perhaps in this case, the answer is straightforward.\n\nIn the given input, the column \"assay\" exists and its value is \"RNA-seq\", a string.

The input data is a JSON string for the row, and the column name is \"replicate\".\n\nFirst, I should parse the row_data. The row_data is a string that represents a JSON object. So I need to parse that into a JSON object. The row_data has a \"row_id\" and a \"columns\" object. The columns object contains the actual data for the columns: experiment_id, replicate, and condition.\n\nLooking at the columns, the \"replicate\" key has a value of 3. Since the task is to retrieve the value of the specified column, which is \"replicate\" here, the value should be 3. The problem says if the value is a number, return it as a number. So in the JSON response, the value should be the number 3, not a string.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no typos in the column name. The input column name is \"replicate\", and in the columns object, the key is also \"replicate\". So that's correct. No issues there.\n\nAlso, check if the value is null, but in this case, it's 3, which is a number. So the JSON response should have \"value\": 3.\n\nI think that's all. Just extract the value from the columns where the key matches the column name provided.\n"
