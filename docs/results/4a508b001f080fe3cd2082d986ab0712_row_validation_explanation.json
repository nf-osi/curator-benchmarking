So, I should parse that to get the actual row details. The row has an ID of 8, columns with \"type\" set to \"unknown\" and \"category\" as \"A\". The validation error says the 'type' column must be one of: standard, custom, default.\n\nThe main issue here is the value of the 'type' column. The allowed values are standard, custom, or default, but the current value is \"unknown\". The error message directly points to this column and the invalid value. The 'category' column isn't mentioned in the errors, so it's probably okay.\n\nI need to structure the explanation in JSON, mentioning the specific column and the allowed values. The explanation should clearly state that 'type' has an invalid value and list the permissible options. I should avoid mentioning the 'category' since it's not part of the error. Also, make sure the explanation is concise and directly addresses the validation error provided.\n"
