The input data is a JSON object containing grid_data, which itself is a stringified JSON.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grid_data. The grid_data has a \"rows\" array, and each row has an \"id\" and a \"valid\" boolean. My task is to go through each row in that array and check if \"valid\" is false. Then count how many such rows there are.\n\nSo, the steps are: parse the grid_data string into a JSON object. Then iterate over each row in the rows array. For each row, check if valid is false. Increment a counter each time that's the case. Finally, return the count in the specified JSON structure.\n\nLet me make sure I don't make any mistakes here. The input's grid_data is a string, so I need to parse it first. Let's look at the example given. The rows are:\n\n[\n  {\"id\": 1, \"valid\": true},\n  {\"id\": 2, \"valid\": false},\n  {\"id\": 3, \"valid\": false},\n  {\"id\": 4, \"valid\": true},\n  {\"id\": 5, \"valid\": false}\n]\n\nIn this case, rows 2, 3, and 5 have valid: false. That's three rows. So the count should be 3. The expected output would be {\"count\": 3}.\n\nI need to ensure that I correctly parse the JSON and loop through each row. Also, make sure that the valid field is explicitly false, not just any falsy value. But according to the data structure, it's a boolean, so checking for valid === false should be safe.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are there any possible missing fields? The problem statement says each row has \"valid\", so I can assume that every row has this property. So no need to handle missing keys.\n\nSo, the process is straightforward. Parse the grid_data, count the rows where valid is false, return the count in the required JSON format.\n",

The input data is a JSON object containing grid_data, which itself is a stringified JSON.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grid_data. The grid_data has a \"rows\" array, and each row has an \"id\" and a \"valid\" boolean. My task is to go through each row in that array and check if \"valid\" is false. Then count how many such rows there are.\n\nSo, the steps are: parse the grid_data string into a JSON object. Then iterate over each row in the rows array. For each row, check if valid is false. Increment a counter each time that's the case. Finally, return the count in the specified JSON structure.\n\nLet me make sure I don't make any mistakes here. The input's grid_data is a string, so I need to parse it first. Let's look at the example given. The rows are:\n\n[\n  {\"id\": 1, \"valid\": true},\n  {\"id\": 2, \"valid\": false},\n  {\"id\": 3, \"valid\": false},\n  {\"id\": 4, \"valid\": true},\n  {\"id\": 5, \"valid\": false}\n]\n\nIn this case, rows 2, 3, and 5 have valid: false. That's three rows. So the count should be 3. The expected output would be {\"count\": 3}.\n\nI need to ensure that I correctly parse the JSON and loop through each row. Also, make sure that the valid field is explicitly false, not just any falsy value. But according to the data structure, it's a boolean, so checking for valid === false should be safe.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are there any possible missing fields? The problem statement says each row has \"valid\", so I can assume that every row has this property. So no need to handle missing keys.\n\nSo, the process is straightforward. Parse the grid_data, count the rows where valid is false, return the count in the required JSON format.\n"

The input data is a JSON structure with grid_data as a string. First, I need to parse the grid_data string into a JSON object.\n\nLooking at the grid_data, it's a string that contains a JSON object with a \"rows\" array. Each row has an \"id\" and a \"valid\" boolean. My task is to iterate through each row in the rows array and check if \"valid\" is false. For each row where valid is false, I increment the count.\n\nSo, let's parse the grid_data. The given grid_data is: \"{\\\"rows\\\": [{\\\"id\\\": 1, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 2, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 3, \\\"valid\\\": false}, {\\\"id\\\": 4, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 5, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 6, \\\"valid\\\": false}]}\". When parsed, this should give an object with a rows array of 6 elements.\n\nNow, loop through each row. Check each row's \"valid\" property. If it's false, add to the count. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: valid true \u2192 no count.\nRow 2: valid true \u2192 no count.\nRow 3: valid false \u2192 count 1.\nRow 4: valid true \u2192 no count.\nRow 5: valid true \u2192 no count.\nRow 6: valid false \u2192 count 2.\n\nSo total count is 2. The JSON response should be {\"count\": 2}.\n\nI need to make sure that the response is correctly formatted as JSON with the count key. Also, ensure that the count is a number, not a string. No other keys should be present. Let me double-check the input data to confirm there are exactly two rows with valid: false. Yes, rows 3 and 6. So the answer is correct.\n",

First, I need to parse the input data correctly.\n\nLooking at the input, there's a \"grid_data\" key which contains a JSON string. So I need to parse that string into a JSON object. The structure is {\"rows\": [array of row objects]}. Each row has an \"id\" and a \"valid\" boolean.\n\nSo the steps are: \n1. Parse the grid_data string into a JSON object.\n2. Iterate over each row in the rows array.\n3. For each row, check if the \"valid\" property is false.\n4. Count all such rows where valid is false.\n\nLet me check the example data. The grid_data has rows with ids 1 to 7. The valid values are true, false, true, false, false, true, false. Let's count the falses: rows 2,4,5,7. That's four rows. So the count should be 4.\n\nWait, let me count again. The rows are:\n1: true\n2: false (1)\n3: true\n4: false (2)\n5: false (3)\n6: true\n7: false (4)\nYes, four in total. So the answer should be {\"count\":4}.\n\nI need to make sure that the JSON response is correctly formatted, with the count as a number. Also, ensure that there are no typos in the keys. The output should be a JSON object with the key \"count\" and the value 4.\n"
