The user provided an input with three fields: diagnosis, assay, and tumorType. My job is to replace any narrow synonyms with the broader terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis. The input is \"Neurofibromatosis type 1 microdeletion syndrome\". The Target Schema's diagnosis enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". Since \"microdeletion syndrome\" is a specific subtype, I should broaden it to the more general term \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\".\n\nNext, the assay is \"clinical whole-exome sequencing\". The Target Schema's assay enum has \"whole exome sequencing\". The input uses \"clinical\" and hyphenates \"whole-exome\", but the correct term is \"whole exome sequencing\" without hyphen and without \"clinical\". So I'll replace it with \"whole exome sequencing\".\n\nLastly, tumorType is \"Plexiform neurofibroma (morphologic abnormality)\". The Target Schema lists \"Plexiform Neurofibroma\". The parentheses and lowercase \"n\" in the input need to be adjusted to match the enum exactly. So it becomes \"Plexiform Neurofibroma\".\n\nI need to ensure all replacements use the exact enum values, check spelling, capitalization, and formatting. No extra words or variations allowed. That should cover all the necessary changes.\n",

The Target Schema's diagnosis enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". Since \"with scoliosis\" is an additional detail not present in the controlled terms, I should remove that part to match the standard term.

The prefix \"anti-tag\" is a specific detail that's not part of the controlled term. By removing \"anti-tag\", the assay should be \"immunocytochemistry\".\n\nFor tumorType: the input is \"sessile cutaneous neurofibroma\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum includes \"Cutaneous Neurofibroma\". The term \"sessile\" is a descriptor that's not in the controlled list.

The Target Schema's assay enum has \"3D microtissue viability\". The original assay mentions 3D and viability, which matches the broader term. The brand name (CellTiter-Glo) is a specific kit, so replacing that with the standard term makes sense.\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"Epithelioid Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\". The Target Schema lists \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\". The epithelioid subtype isn't in the enum, so the broader term without the subtype is correct here.\n\nI need to ensure all replacements use the exact enum values. No variations allowed.

                        "text": "Okay, let's tackle this metadata correction step by step. The user provided an input with three fields: diagnosis, assay, and tumorType. My job is to replace any narrow synonyms with the broader terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis. The input is \"neurofibromatosis type 1 due to NF1 mutation or intragenic deletion\". The Target Schema's diagnosis enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". The original term adds specifics about NF1 mutations, but the schema's term is the broader standard. So I should replace the entire diagnosis with \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\".\n\nNext, the assay is \"CellTiter-Glo\u00ae 3D Cell Viability Assay\". The Target Schema's assay enum has \"3D microtissue viability\". The original assay mentions 3D and viability, which matches the broader term. The brand name (CellTiter-Glo) is a specific kit, so replacing that with the standard term makes sense.\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"Epithelioid Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\". The Target Schema lists \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\". The epithelioid subtype isn't in the enum, so the broader term without the subtype is correct here.\n\nI need to ensure all replacements use the exact enum values. No variations allowed. So the corrected JSON should have the three fields updated to their respective broader terms exactly as listed.\n"
