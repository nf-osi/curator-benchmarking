The user wants me to broaden narrow synonyms in the input data to match the Target Schema's controlled terminology.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis field. The input is \"Neurofibromatosis type 1 microdeletion syndrome\". The Target Schema's enum for diagnosis includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". Since \"microdeletion syndrome\" is a specific subtype, the broader term here would be \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". So I'll replace that.\n\nNext, the assay is \"clinical whole-exome sequencing\". The Target Schema's assay enum has \"whole exome sequencing\". The input uses \"clinical\" and hyphenates \"whole-exome\", but the correct term is \"whole exome sequencing\" without hyphen and without \"clinical\". So I'll adjust that to match exactly.\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"Plexiform neurofibroma (morphologic abnormality)\". The Target Schema lists \"Plexiform Neurofibroma\" with a capital N and without the parenthetical. So I'll capitalize \"neurofibroma\" and remove the extra text to match the enum exactly.\n\nI need to ensure all replacements use the exact terms from the schema, no variations. Let me double-check each field against the enums provided. Diagnosis: yes, \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" is there. Assay: \"whole exome sequencing\" is present. TumorType: \"Plexiform Neurofibroma\" is listed. All look good. Now, structure the JSON output to match the input's structure with corrected values.\n",

The user wants me to replace narrow synonyms with broader terms from the Target Schema. Let's start with the diagnosis field. The input is \"neurofibromatosis, familial spinal\". Looking at the Target Schema's diagnosis enum, the closest match is \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". Wait, but \"familial spinal\" might be a specific type. However, the schema doesn't have that exact term. The options include \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\", \"Schwannomatosis\", etc. Since \"familial spinal neurofibromatosis\" is a subtype of NF1, I think \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" is the correct broader term here.\n\nNext, the assay is \"open MRI\". The Target Schema's assay enum has \"conventional MRI\" and \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\". \"Open MRI\" is a type of MRI machine design, but the schema doesn't list it. The closest standard term would be \"conventional MRI\" as the general category.\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"unknown - no information available\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum has \"Unknown\" as an option. So replacing the input with \"Unknown\" makes sense here.\n\nI need to ensure that all replacements exactly match the enum values. Let me double-check each field. Diagnosis: \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" is in the list. Assay: \"conventional MRI\" is present. TumorType: \"Unknown\" is correct. Alright, that should be it.\n",

Let's start with the diagnosis field. The input is \"neurofibromatosis, familial spinal\". Looking at the Target Schema's diagnosis enum, the closest match is \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". Wait, but \"familial spinal\" might be a specific type. However, the schema doesn't have that exact term. The options include \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\", \"Schwannomatosis\", etc. Since \"familial spinal neurofibromatosis\" is a subtype of NF1, I think \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" is the correct broader term here.\n\nNext, the assay is \"open MRI\". The Target Schema's assay enum has \"conventional MRI\" and \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\". \"Open MRI\" is a type of MRI machine design, but the schema doesn't list it. The closest standard term would be \"conventional MRI\" as the general category.\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"unknown - no information available\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum has \"Unknown\" as an option. So replacing the input with \"Unknown\" makes sense here.\n\nI need to ensure that all replacements exactly match the enum values.

Since \"peripheral type\" might refer to type 1, which is a common form, I should replace it with \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\".\n\nNext, the assay is \"wide bore MRI\". The Target Schema's assay enum has \"conventional MRI\" and other MRI types like \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\". \"Wide bore\" might be a specific type, but the general term here is \"conventional MRI\", so I'll use that.\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"no clear diagnosis\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum includes \"Unknown\". Since \"no clear diagnosis\" implies uncertainty, \"Unknown\" is the appropriate replacement.\n\nI need to ensure all replacements exactly match the Target Schema's enums.

The user wants me to broaden narrow synonyms in the input data using the exact terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis field. The input is \"acoustic neurofibromatosis\". I need to check the enum list in the Target Schema for the diagnosis. The options include \"Vestibular Schwannoma\", \"Schwannomatosis\", and others. Wait, \"acoustic neuroma\" is another term for vestibular schwannoma, but \"acoustic neurofibromatosis\" might be an older term. The correct term in the schema is \"Vestibular Schwannoma\" or maybe \"Schwannomatosis\"? Hmm, but \"neurofibromatosis\" is different from schwannomatosis. Wait, the schema has \"Vestibular Schwannoma\" as a diagnosis option. But wait, the diagnosis enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\", \"Schwannomatosis\", etc. Wait, \"acoustic neurofibromatosis\" might be a misnomer. Vestibular schwannoma is a type of schwannoma, and schwannomatosis is a condition where multiple schwannomas develop. But the diagnosis here is \"acoustic neurofibromatosis\", which isn't in the schema. Maybe it's a synonym for \"Vestibular Schwannoma\"? Or perhaps \"Schwannomatosis\"? Alternatively, maybe \"Schwannomatosis-NOS\" if it's not specified. But the correct term in the schema for vestibular schwannoma as a diagnosis is \"Vestibular Schwannoma\". So I think the diagnosis should be mapped to \"Vestibular Schwannoma\".\n\nNext, the assay is \"RNA-seq with ribosomal RNA depletion\". The Target Schema's assay enum includes \"RNA-seq\" as a standard term. The additional detail about ribosomal RNA depletion is a specific protocol, but the task is to broaden to the general term. So replace with \"RNA-seq\".\n\nFor tumorType: \"Acoustic neuroma of left vestibular nerve\". The tumorType enum has \"Schwannoma\" as an option. Since \"acoustic neuroma\" is another name for vestibular schwannoma, but the tumorType enum doesn't have \"Vestibular Schwannoma\" listed. Wait, checking the tumorType enum: the options include \"Schwannoma\", \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\", etc. So \"Acoustic neuroma\" is a type of schwannoma, so the correct term here is \"Schwannoma\".\n\nSo the corrected entries would be:\n\ndiagnosis: \"Vestibular Schwannoma\"\n\nassay: \"RNA-seq\"\n\ntumorType: \"Schwannoma\"\n\nI need to make sure these are exact matches in the Target Schema.
