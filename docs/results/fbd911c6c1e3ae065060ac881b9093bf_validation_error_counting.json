The input data is given as a JSON object with a 'grid_data' string that contains another JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I should parse the 'grid_data' string into a JSON object. The 'grid_data' has a 'rows' array, and each row is an object with 'id' and 'valid' properties. My task is to iterate through each row in the 'rows' array and check if 'valid' is false. For each row where 'valid' is false, I increment the count.\n\nWait, the input data's 'grid_data' is a string, so I need to parse that first. Let me make sure I parse it correctly. Once parsed, I can access the 'rows' array. Then loop through each row, check the 'valid' value. If it's false, add to the count.\n\nLet me check the example given. The sample rows are:\n- id 1: valid true\n- id 2: valid false\n- id 3: valid true\n- id 4: valid false\n\nSo in this case, there are 2 rows with validation errors. The expected count would be 2. So the output should be {\"count\": 2}.\n\nI need to make sure that the code correctly parses the JSON, iterates through each row, and counts the ones where valid is false. Also, handle any possible parsing errors, but assuming the input is well-formed as per the problem statement.\n\nSo the steps are:\n1. Parse the 'grid_data' string into a JSON object.\n2. Access the 'rows' array.\n3. Initialize a count to 0.\n4. For each row in rows, check if 'valid' is false.\n5. Increment count for each false.\n6. Return the count in the specified JSON structure.\n\nI need to ensure that the 'valid' field is a boolean and not a string. For example, if the JSON has \"valid\": \"false\" as a string, that's different. But according to the input example, the valid values are booleans (true/false), so I can safely check for the boolean false.\n\nSo, in the given input, after parsing, the rows array has 4 elements. Two of them have 'valid' as false. Therefore, the count is 2. The answer should be {\"count\": 2}.\n",

So, the value of grid_data is a string, so I need to parse that first. For example, in Python, I would use json.loads(input_data['grid_data']) to get the actual data structure.\n\n2. Once parsed, access the \"rows\" array. Then loop through each row in the array.\n\n3. For each row, check if the \"valid\" key is False. If it is, add to the count.\n\n4. After checking all rows, return a JSON object with the count of such rows.\n\nLooking at the example input data: the grid_data has rows with ids 1 to 5. The valid fields are true, false, false, true, false. So rows 2, 3, and 5 are invalid. That's three rows. So the count should be 3.\n\nI need to make sure that I correctly parse the nested JSON. Also, ensure that the 'valid' key is present in each row.

So count is 3. The answer should be {\"count\":3}.\n\nI need to make sure that the JSON structure in the response is exactly as specified, with the key \"count\" and the value as the integer. Also, ensure that the count is a non-negative integer, which in this case it is.\n\nNo edge cases here, but if there were no rows with valid: false, the count would be 0. If all rows were invalid, count would be the total number of rows. But in the given data, it's 3.\n",

For each row where valid is false, I increment the count. \n\nLet me make sure I understand the structure correctly. The input is a JSON where grid_data is a string representation of another JSON. So I need to parse that string first. For example, in Python, I would use json.loads on grid_data to get the actual data structure.\n\nOnce parsed, the rows are in a list under the \"rows\" key. Then, loop through each row in that list. For each row, check if row['valid'] is False. If yes, add to the count. \n\nLet me check the example data. The grid_data has rows with ids 1-6. Rows 3 and 6 have valid: false. So the count should be 2. \n\nWait, the input data's grid_data is a string, so I need to parse it. Let me verify that. The input is:\n\n{\n  \"grid_data\": \"{\\\"rows\\\": [{\\\"id\\\": 1, \\\"valid\\\": true}, ... ]}\",\n  ...\n}\n\nSo when parsed, grid_data becomes a dictionary with a 'rows' key. Then, each element in rows is a dict. So the steps are:\n\n1. Parse the input JSON to get the main object.\n2. Extract the \"grid_data\" value, which is a string, and parse that into another JSON object.\n3. Access the \"rows\" array in the parsed grid_data.\n4. Iterate over each row in rows.\n5. For each row, check if 'valid' is False.\n6. Count all such rows.\n\nPotential issues: What if a row doesn't have a 'valid' key? But according to the problem statement, the grid has row validation status info, so probably all rows have 'valid'. But maybe in some cases, it's missing. However, the problem says to count where valid is false, so if 'valid' is missing, perhaps it's considered as valid? Or maybe it's an error. But the example given includes all rows with 'valid' present. So I'll assume that each row has the 'valid' key.\n\nAnother thing: the 'valid' value is a boolean. So in JSON, it's either true or false (lowercase in JSON). So in Python, after parsing, they become True or False (capitalized in Python). So when checking, in Python, it's if row['valid'] is False.\n\nSo the count would be the number of rows where row['valid'] is False. In the example, that's 2 rows (id 3 and 6). So the answer should be {\"count\": 2}.\n\nI need to make sure that the code correctly parses the nested JSON. For example, in Python, the input data is a JSON object, which when parsed, has a \"grid_data\" key whose value is a string. Then, we parse that string into another JSON object, which has the \"rows\" array.\n\nSo the steps in code (pseudocode):\n\ninput_json = parse the input JSON string\ngrid_data_str = input_json['grid_data']\ngrid_data = json.loads(grid_data_str)\nrows = grid_data['rows']\ncount = 0\nfor row in rows:\n    if not row['valid']:\n        count +=1\nreturn {\"count\": count}\n\nYes, that's the approach. Now, considering edge cases. What if there are no rows with valid: false? Then count is 0. If all rows are invalid, count is the total number. Also, if the rows array is empty, count is 0. All these cases should be handled correctly.\n\nSo the final answer should be a JSON object with the count. The example input should return count 2.\n",

The input data is given as a JSON object. First, I should parse the grid_data string into a JSON object. The grid_data has a \"rows\" array, and each row is an object with \"id\" and \"valid\" properties.\n\nSo, the steps are: parse the grid_data from the input, loop through each row in the rows array, check if the 'valid' key is present and set to false. For each row that meets this condition, increment a counter. Finally, return the count in the specified JSON format.\n\nWait, the input's grid_data is a string that contains another JSON. So I need to parse it twice. First, parse the outer JSON to get the grid_data string, then parse that string into the actual grid data structure.\n\nLet me check the input again. The input is:\n\n{\n  \"grid_data\": \"{\\\"rows\\\": [{\\\"id\\\": 1, \\\"valid\\\": false}]}\",\n  \"question\": \"How many rows have a validation error?\"\n}\n\nSo grid_data is a string that represents a JSON object. So in code terms, I need to first parse the input JSON, then parse the grid_data value into another JSON object. Then access the rows array.\n\nIn this example, there's one row with \"valid\": false. So the count should be 1.\n\nWhat if there are multiple rows? For example, if some rows have valid: true and others false. Need to count only those with false.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that the 'valid' key exists. But according to the problem statement, the rows have validation status information, so probably each row has the 'valid' key.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Parse the input JSON to get grid_data string.\n2. Parse grid_data into a JSON object.\n3. Iterate over each row in rows array.\n4. For each row, check if row.valid is false.\n5. Count all such rows.\n6. Return the count in the specified JSON format.\n\nTesting with the example input: the count is 1. So the output should be {\"count\": 1}.\n\nAnother test case: if there are three rows, two with valid: false, then count is 2.\n\nEdge cases: if no rows, count is 0. If all rows are valid (valid: true), count is 0. If a row has valid missing, maybe treat it as valid? But the problem says \"where valid is false\", so only count when valid is explicitly false. So if a row doesn't have the 'valid' key, it's not counted.\n\nSo the code logic should check for the presence of 'valid' and that it's false.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the grid has row validation status information, so each row should have the 'valid' key. So perhaps we can assume that. But in code, maybe we should check if 'valid' exists to avoid errors. But the problem says \"where valid is false\", so if the key is missing, it's not considered an error. So only count when valid is explicitly false.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ncount = 0\nfor row in rows:\n    if 'valid' in row and row['valid'] is False:\n        count +=1\n\nBut in the given example, the row has \"valid\": false. So in JSON, that's parsed as a boolean. So in Python, for example, it would be False.\n\nSo the answer here is 1. The JSON output should be {\"count\": 1}.\n",

                        "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to count the number of rows in the grid data where the 'valid' field is false. The input data is given as a JSON object. First, I should parse the grid_data string into a JSON object. The grid_data has a \"rows\" array, and each row is an object with \"id\" and \"valid\" properties.\n\nSo, the steps are: parse the grid_data from the input, loop through each row in the rows array, check if the 'valid' key is present and set to false. For each row that meets this condition, increment a counter. Finally, return the count in the specified JSON format.\n\nWait, the input's grid_data is a string that contains another JSON. So I need to parse it twice. First, parse the outer JSON to get the grid_data string, then parse that string into the actual grid data structure.\n\nLet me check the input again. The input is:\n\n{\n  \"grid_data\": \"{\\\"rows\\\": [{\\\"id\\\": 1, \\\"valid\\\": false}]}\",\n  \"question\": \"How many rows have a validation error?\"\n}\n\nSo grid_data is a string that represents a JSON object. So in code terms, I need to first parse the input JSON, then parse the grid_data value into another JSON object. Then access the rows array.\n\nIn this example, there's one row with \"valid\": false. So the count should be 1.\n\nWhat if there are multiple rows? For example, if some rows have valid: true and others false. Need to count only those with false.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that the 'valid' key exists. But according to the problem statement, the rows have validation status information, so probably each row has the 'valid' key.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Parse the input JSON to get grid_data string.\n2. Parse grid_data into a JSON object.\n3. Iterate over each row in rows array.\n4. For each row, check if row.valid is false.\n5. Count all such rows.\n6. Return the count in the specified JSON format.\n\nTesting with the example input: the count is 1. So the output should be {\"count\": 1}.\n\nAnother test case: if there are three rows, two with valid: false, then count is 2.\n\nEdge cases: if no rows, count is 0. If all rows are valid (valid: true), count is 0. If a row has valid missing, maybe treat it as valid? But the problem says \"where valid is false\", so only count when valid is explicitly false. So if a row doesn't have the 'valid' key, it's not counted.\n\nSo the code logic should check for the presence of 'valid' and that it's false.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the grid has row validation status information, so each row should have the 'valid' key. So perhaps we can assume that. But in code, maybe we should check if 'valid' exists to avoid errors. But the problem says \"where valid is false\", so if the key is missing, it's not considered an error. So only count when valid is explicitly false.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ncount = 0\nfor row in rows:\n    if 'valid' in row and row['valid'] is False:\n        count +=1\n\nBut in the given example, the row has \"valid\": false. So in JSON, that's parsed as a boolean. So in Python, for example, it would be False.\n\nSo the answer here is 1. The JSON output should be {\"count\": 1}.\n"

Also, the 'valid' value is a boolean, so no need to handle other types here.\n\nLooking at the input data provided, the rows are:\n\nid 1: valid false \u2192 invalid\nid 2: valid true \u2192 valid\nid 3: valid false \u2192 invalid\nid 4: valid true \u2192 valid\nid 5: valid false \u2192 invalid\nid 6: valid true \u2192 valid\nid 7: valid false \u2192 invalid\nid 8: valid true \u2192 valid\n\nSo counting the invalid ones: 1,3,5,7. That's four rows. So the count should be 4.\n\nI need to make sure that the code correctly parses the grid_data string. The outer JSON has a grid_data key whose value is a string that represents another JSON object. So first, parse the outer JSON, then parse the grid_data string into an object, then process the rows.\n\nThe final answer should be a JSON object with a 'count' key and the number as the value. So the correct answer here is {\"count\":4}.\n"

The input data is a JSON structure that includes a grid_data string, which itself is a JSON string.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grid_data. The grid_data is given as a string, so I'll have to parse it into a JSON object. Once parsed, there's a 'rows' array. Each element in this array is an object with 'id' and 'valid' properties. \n\nThe task is to count how many of these rows have 'valid' set to false. So I need to iterate through each row in the rows array and check the 'valid' value. For each row where 'valid' is false, increment a counter.\n\nLooking at the provided grid_data, the rows array has 10 elements, and each of them has 'valid': false. So the count should be 10. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that there's no possibility of other values. For example, if any row had 'valid' as true, it wouldn't be counted. But in this case, all 10 rows are invalid. So the count is definitely 10. \n\nI need to structure the answer as a JSON object with a 'count' key. So the final answer should be {\"count\": 10}.\n",
