Hmm, looking at the enum list for diagnosis, I see \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" as an option. \"FN1\" is probably a typo for \"NF1\", which is a common abbreviation for Neurofibromatosis type 1. So I should correct \"FN1\" to \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" to match the exact enum value.\n\nNext, the \"assay\" is listed as \"conventonal MRI\". The correct spelling in the assay enum is \"conventional MRI\". The typo here is an extra 'n' in \"conventonal\". So I need to fix that to \"conventional MRI\".\n\nLastly, the \"tumorType\" is \"unknwon\". That's clearly a misspelling of \"Unknown\". Checking the tumorType enum, \"Unknown\" is an option. So correcting the spelling to \"Unknown\".\n\nI need to make sure all corrections exactly match the enum values provided. No variations allowed. Let me double-check each term again to be safe.

So I need to fix that to \"conventional MRI\".\n\nLastly, the \"tumorType\" is \"unknwon\". That's clearly a misspelling of \"Unknown\". Checking the tumorType enum, \"Unknown\" is an option.
