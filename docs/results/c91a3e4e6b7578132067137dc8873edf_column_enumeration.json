The user provided a grid structure in JSON format and is asking for the list of column names. My task is to parse the input, extract the column names in order, and return them as a JSON array.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the input data. The grid_structure is a string that represents a JSON object. It has a \"columns\" key, which is an array of objects. Each object in the array has a \"name\" and a \"type\" field. The goal is to collect all the \"name\" values from these objects.\n\nWait, the grid_structure is given as a string, so I'll need to parse that string into a JSON object first. Once parsed, I can access the columns array. Then, iterate over each column in the array and collect the \"name\" values. The order is important, so I have to maintain the sequence as they appear in the array.\n\nLet me check the example input again. The grid_structure string contains columns named \"gene\", \"expression\", and \"p_value\". So the expected output should be an array with those three names in that exact order.\n\nI need to make sure that the JSON parsing is done correctly. If there are any syntax errors in the grid_structure string, that could cause issues. But assuming the input is well-formed, parsing should work. Once parsed, extracting the names should be straightforward.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the output format must be a JSON object with a \"columns\" key, and the value is an array of strings. No additional fields, just the list of column names. Also, the order must match the original order in the grid_structure.\n\nSo the steps are: parse the grid_structure string into a JSON object, extract the columns array, map each element to its \"name\" value, and then structure the result as specified.\n\nI should also verify that there are no typos in the keys, like \"name\" being correctly spelled. The input seems to have \"name\" and \"type\", so that's correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the final JSON response should list the column names in the correct order. Testing with the given example, the output should be:\n\n{\n  \"columns\": [\"gene\", \"expression\", \"p_value\"]\n}\n\nYes, that matches the input columns. I think that's all. Just need to ensure the code or logic correctly follows these steps.\n",
