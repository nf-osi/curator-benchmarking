The typo \"exme\" should be \"exome\", and \"squencing\" is missing an 'e', so it's \"sequencing\". Checking the enum list for assay, yes, \"whole exome sequencing\" is there.\n\nThen, the tumorType is \"Plexifform Neurofibroma\". The correct term in the schema is \"Plexiform Neurofibroma\". The typo here is \"Plexifform\" which should be \"Plexiform\". I'll correct that spelling.\n\nI need to make sure all the corrected terms exactly match the enums provided.
