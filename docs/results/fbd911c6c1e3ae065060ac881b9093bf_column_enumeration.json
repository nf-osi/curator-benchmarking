The input data has a \"grid_structure\" which is a JSON string. I need to parse that.\n\nFirst, I should parse the grid_structure from the input.

The task is to extract all the \"name\" values from each object in the columns array.\n\nLooking at the example given, the grid_structure's columns array has three entries: gene, expression, and p_value. Each of these has a name. So the expected output should be an array with those three names in the same order.\n\nI need to make sure that the order is preserved as they appear in the columns array. Also, the response should be a JSON object with a \"columns\" key, and the value is the array of names. No extra fields or information should be included. Just the list of column names in order.\n\nI should check if there are any other possible columns or if the structure could be different, but based on the input provided, it's straightforward. The grid_structure is correctly formatted, so parsing it shouldn't be an issue. Once parsed, extract each \"name\" from the columns array and compile them into the list.\n\nSo the final JSON should look like:\n\n{\n  \"columns\": [\"gene\", \"expression\", \"p_value\"]\n}\n\nThat's it.

First, I need to parse that JSON string to get the actual columns array.\n\nLooking at the grid_structure value, it's a string that represents a JSON object with a \"columns\" key. Each element in the columns array has a \"name\" field. So my task is to extract all the \"name\" values from each object in the columns array and list them in the order they appear.\n\nLet me parse the grid_structure. The outer quotes are escaped, so when parsed, it should become a valid JSON object. The columns array has four objects: subject, treatment, outcome, and score. Each has a name and type. So the column names are exactly those four names in that order.\n\nI need to make sure that the JSON output I return has a \"columns\" array with these names. Let me double-check that there are no typos. The names are subject, treatment, outcome, score. Order is important here, so I have to maintain the sequence as given in the input. Once confirmed, I can structure the JSON response accordingly.\n"
