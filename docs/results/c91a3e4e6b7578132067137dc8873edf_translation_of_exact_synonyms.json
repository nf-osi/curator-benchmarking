The user provided an input JSON with three fields: diagnosis, assay, and tumorType. My job is to replace any synonyms in these fields with the exact terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis field. The input is \"ORPHA:636\". ORPHA codes are identifiers from Orphanet, a database for rare diseases. I need to find out what condition ORPHA:636 corresponds to. A quick check tells me that ORPHA:636 is Neurofibromatosis type 1. Checking the Target Schema's diagnosis enum, \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" is listed. So that's a direct replacement.\n\nNext, the assay field is \"WGS\". WGS usually stands for Whole Genome Sequencing. Looking at the assay enum in the Target Schema, \"whole genome sequencing\" is present but written in lowercase. Wait, the schema's enum entries are case-sensitive? Let me check. The entries are in title case or specific formats. For example, \"whole exome sequencing\" is in the list, so \"whole genome sequencing\" should be the correct term. But in the schema, the exact entry is \"whole genome sequencing\" with all lowercase except the first letters. Wait, no, looking at the schema's assay enum, entries like \"quantitative PCR\" are in lowercase except proper nouns. Wait, no, the entries are in title case. For example, \"2D AlamarBlue absorbance\", \"3D confocal imaging\", etc. So \"Whole Genome Sequencing\" would be the correct format. Wait, checking the Target Schema's assay enum again. Let me look through the list. There's \"whole exome sequencing\", \"whole genome sequencing\", and \"whole transcriptome sequencing\" all in lowercase except the first letter of each word. Wait, no, the actual entries are in the schema as \"whole exome sequencing\", \"whole genome sequencing\", etc., with each word lowercase except proper nouns. Wait, looking at the schema's assay enum list, entries like \"quantitative PCR\" are lowercase except acronyms. So \"whole genome sequencing\" is the exact term in the schema. So \"WGS\" should be replaced with \"whole genome sequencing\".\n\nNow, the tumorType is \"MPN tumor\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum includes \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\". \"MPNST\" is the abbreviation for that. The input says \"MPN tumor\", which is likely a typo or shorthand for MPNST. So replacing \"MPN tumor\" with \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\" makes sense. Checking the tumorType enum, yes, that exact term is present.\n\nSo the corrected JSON should have:\n- diagnosis: \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\"\n- assay: \"whole genome sequencing\"\n- tumorType: \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\"\n\nI need to ensure that all replacements are exact matches from the Target Schema's enums.

The user provided an input with three fields: diagnosis, assay, and tumorType. My job is to replace any synonyms with the exact terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, the diagnosis is \"Von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis\". I remember that Von Recklinghausen's disease is another name for Neurofibromatosis type 1. Checking the Target Schema's diagnosis enum, \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" is listed. So that's the correct replacement.\n\nNext, the assay is \"MRS\". MRS stands for Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Looking at the assay enum, \"magnetic resonance spectroscopy\" is present. Need to make sure the case matches. The schema uses lowercase for the assay entries, so \"magnetic resonance spectroscopy\" is the right choice.\n\nThen, tumorType is \"NOS\". NOS usually means \"Not Otherwise Specified\". In the tumorType enum, there's \"Not Applicable\", \"Unknown\", and others. Wait, \"NOS\" in medical terms can sometimes map to \"Not Otherwise Specified\", but looking at the tumorType options, \"High-Grade Glioma NOS\" and \"Low-Grade Glioma NOS\" include NOS, but the input's tumorType is just \"NOS\". The schema's tumorType enum has \"Not Applicable\" and \"Unknown\". Since \"NOS\" alone isn't listed, maybe \"Not Applicable\" is the closest? Or perhaps \"Unknown\"? But \"NOS\" as a standalone might not be in the schema. Wait, the input's tumorType is \"NOS\", but in the Target Schema, the tumorType enum includes \"Not Applicable\" and \"Unknown\". Since \"NOS\" isn't a direct match here, but in some contexts, \"NOS\" could mean \"Not Otherwise Specified\", which isn't present. The closest might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not Applicable\". However, looking at the tumorType enum, there's \"Schwannoma\" and others, but \"NOS\" as a tumorType isn't listed. The user might have intended \"Not Applicable\" if the tumor type isn't specified, but \"NOS\" usually isn't the same as \"Not Applicable\". Alternatively, maybe \"Unknown\" is more appropriate. But the Target Schema's tumorType enum doesn't have a \"NOS\" entry. Wait, the tumorType enum does have \"High-Grade Glioma NOS\" and \"Low-Grade Glioma NOS\", but those are specific to glioma. The input's tumorType is just \"NOS\", which doesn't fit those. So perhaps the correct term here is \"Unknown\" since \"NOS\" isn't a valid option. Alternatively, maybe \"Not Applicable\" if it's not applicable. But without more context, \"Unknown\" might be safer. However, the user's instruction says to use exact terms from the schema. Since \"NOS\" isn't present as a standalone, but \"Not Applicable\" and \"Unknown\" are options, I need to determine which is correct. If the original data has \"NOS\" as the tumor type, but the schema doesn't have a matching entry, perhaps \"Unknown\" is the best fit. Alternatively, maybe the input was a mistake, but according to the instructions, we have to map to the exact terms. Since \"NOS\" isn't in the tumorType enum, but \"Not Applicable\" and \"Unknown\" are, I'll have to choose between them. If \"NOS\" in this context means that the tumor type isn't specified further, \"Unknown\" might be the right choice. So, replacing \"NOS\" with \"Unknown\" in tumorType.\n\nWait, but looking back, the tumorType enum does have \"Not Applicable\" and \"Unknown\". If the tumorType is not applicable (e.g., the sample isn't a tumor), then \"Not Applicable\" would be correct. If the tumor type is known to exist but not specified, \"Unknown\" is better. Since the input is \"NOS\", which in medical coding often means \"Not Otherwise Specified\", implying that it's a known tumor but not further classified, but since the schema doesn't have a \"NOS\" option for tumorType, the closest might be \"Unknown\". Alternatively, maybe the input intended \"Not Applicable\". Without more context, it's a bit ambiguous, but according to the Target Schema, \"Not Applicable\" and \"Unknown\" are options. Given that, perhaps \"Unknown\" is the correct replacement for \"NOS\" in tumorType.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Diagnosis: \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\"\n- Assay: \"magnetic resonance spectroscopy\"\n- TumorType: \"Unknown\"\n\nWait, but the assay enum has \"MRS\" as \"magnetic resonance spectroscopy\"? Let me check again. The assay enum includes \"magnetic resonance spectroscopy\" exactly. The input was \"MRS\", which is the abbreviation. Since the Target Schema expects the full term, \"magnetic resonance spectroscopy\" is the correct replacement.\n\nYes, that's right. So the corrected JSON should have those values.\n",

First, I need to check each field in the input data against the Target Schema's controlled terminology.\n\nStarting with \"diagnosis\": the input is \"neurofibromatosis 1\". The Target Schema's enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". The input uses a lowercase 'n' and the numeral '1' instead of 'type 1'. The correct term should be \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" with proper capitalization and wording.\n\nNext, the \"assay\" field is \"ICC\". Looking at the assay enums, \"Immunocytochemistry\" is the full term. \"ICC\" is a common abbreviation for Immunocytochemistry, so it should be replaced with the exact enum value \"immunocytochemistry\" (note the lowercase 'i' here?

The Target Schema's diagnosis enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". \"NF1\" is a common abbreviation for Neurofibromatosis type 1, and \"Nonmosaic\" might indicate it's not mosaic, but the schema doesn't have a specific entry for that. The closest match is \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\", so I'll replace \"Nonmosaic NF1\" with that.\n\nNext, the assay is \"3D microtissue survival assay\". Looking at the assay enum, there's \"3D microtissue viability\". \"Survival assay\" is a synonym for viability assay in this context. So the correct term here should be \"3D microtissue viability\".\n\nFor tumorType: \"neurofibrosarcoma\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum lists \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\". Neurofibrosarcoma is an older term that's now classified under MPNST. So replacing \"neurofibrosarcoma\" with \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\" makes sense.\n\nI need to ensure that each replacement uses the exact terms from the enums provided. No variations are allowed. Let me double-check each enum list again to confirm. Yes, all replacements are exact matches. The JSON structure should remain the same, just with the updated values.\n"
