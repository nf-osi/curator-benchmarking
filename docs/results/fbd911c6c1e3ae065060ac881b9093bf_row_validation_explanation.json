The user provided a row with some data and validation errors, and I need to explain why the row is invalid.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the input data. The row_data is a JSON object. The row has an ID of 1, and two columns: \"a\" with a null value and \"b\" with the string \"no id\". The validation error listed is \"Column 'a' is required but is null\".\n\nSo, the main issue here is with column 'a'. The error message clearly states that this column is required, meaning it can't be null. Even though column 'b' has a value \"no id\", there's no validation error mentioned for it. The presence of a null in a required field makes the entire row invalid.\n\nI need to structure the explanation to reference the specific error and the problematic column. The explanation should mention column 'a' being required and having a null value. Since there's only one validation error, the focus is solely on column 'a'. The other column's data isn't part of the error, so it's not necessary to mention it unless it's contributing to the problem, which it isn't here.\n\nSo the JSON response should have an explanation that states column 'a' is required but is null, leading to the row being invalid.\n",

The validation error says the email must be a valid email address. \n\nThe email value is \"invalid-email\", which clearly isn't a proper email format. It's missing the @ symbol and a domain part.
