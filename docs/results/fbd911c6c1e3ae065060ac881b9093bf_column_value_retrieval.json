Since 3 is a number, the value should be returned as a number, not a string. The JSON structure required is {\"value\": 3}. I need to make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted and that there are no syntax errors. Also, check if there's any possibility of the column not existing or the value being null, but in this case, it's present and a number. So the final answer should be the JSON with value 3.\n"

The columns are another object with keys like subject, treatment, outcome, and score.\n\nThe column name we're interested in is \"score\". So I need to look into the columns object and get the value associated with the \"score\" key. Let me check the columns: the score is 85.

I need to make sure that the number isn't quoted, so it's recognized as a number in JSON. Also, if the value was null or a string, I would handle those cases accordingly.
