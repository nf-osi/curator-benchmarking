The example they provided has \"hello world\" becoming \"HELLO WORLD\" in a JSON object with the key \"uppercase\". \n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the structure they want. The input is a JSON object with a \"text\" field. My job is to take that text, convert all characters to uppercase, then put it into a new JSON object under the \"uppercase\" key.\n\nSo, if the input text is \"hello world\", converting to uppercase gives \"HELLO WORLD\". Then, the JSON response should be {\"uppercase\": \"HELLO WORLD\"}. \n\nI should check if there are any edge cases, like special characters or numbers. But the example is straightforward. The main thing is to ensure the conversion is correct and the JSON structure is exactly as specified. Also, need to make sure there are no extra spaces or formatting issues. \n\nAnother thing to consider is case sensitivity. The input could have mixed cases, but the conversion should handle all letters. For instance, \"HeLLo\" becomes \"HELLO\". \n\nI think that's it. The process is simple: take the text value, apply the uppercase transformation, and structure the output correctly. No need for any additional processing unless specified, which it isn't.
