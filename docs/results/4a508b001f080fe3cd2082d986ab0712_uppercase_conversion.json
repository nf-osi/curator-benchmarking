The example they provided has \"hello world\" becoming \"HELLO WORLD\" in a JSON object with the key \"uppercase\". \n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the structure they want. The input is a JSON object with a \"text\" field. My job is to take that text, convert all characters to uppercase, then wrap it in another JSON object with the key \"uppercase\".\n\nSo, the steps are: read the input JSON, extract the \"text\" value, apply the uppercase transformation, then construct the output JSON correctly. \n\nI should check if there are any edge cases, like if the input text is empty or contains special characters. But according to the example, it's straightforward. Also, the output must be valid JSON, so proper escaping isn't needed here since it's just uppercase letters and spaces in the example. \n\nWait, the user mentioned to return the response as JSON with the specified structure. So I need to ensure that the JSON syntax is correct\u2014commas, braces, quotes. For instance, if the input text had quotes, they'd need to be escaped, but in the given example, that's not an issue.\n\nTesting with the sample input: {\"text\": \"hello world\"} should result in {\"uppercase\": \"HELLO WORLD\"}. That looks right. \n\nI should also make sure that the case conversion is done properly. In Python, the .upper() method would handle that. So, taking the input text, applying .upper(), then placing it into the JSON structure. \n\nNo other processing is required. The task is straightforward. Just need to ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted in the output.\n",
