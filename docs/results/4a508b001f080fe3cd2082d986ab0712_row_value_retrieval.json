Similarly, the selected_columns is a JSON array string, so I need to parse that as well.\n\nThe row_data has a \"row_id\" and a \"columns\" object.

The row_data is {\"row_id\": 1, \"columns\": {\"a\": 1, \"b\": \"one\"}}, and selected_columns are [\"a\", \"b\"].

I need to extract specific column values from a given row based on the selected columns. The input data has a row_data object, which is a JSON string. First, I should parse that row_data to get the actual data structure.\n\nThe row_data is a JSON string, so I'll parse it into a Python dictionary. Then, looking at the \"columns\" key inside that, that's where the actual column data is stored. The selected_columns is also a JSON array string, so I need to parse that as well to get the list of column names the user wants.\n\nSo, the steps are: parse row_data into a dict, access the 'columns' part, then for each column in selected_columns, get the corresponding value from the columns dict. Then, construct a JSON object with those key-value pairs, making sure to keep the data types as they are. For example, if a value is a number, it should stay a number, not a string. But in the example given, patient_id is \"P001\" (string), diagnosis is \"NF1\" (string), age is 25 (number). The selected columns are patient_id and diagnosis, so the output should have those two keys with their respective string values.\n\nWait, the input's selected_columns is [\"patient_id\", \"diagnosis\"], so the output JSON should have those keys. The row in question is row_id 2, but the question mentions \"first row\", but maybe that's a typo. Regardless, the row_data provided is for row_id 2, but the task is to extract from that row regardless of the row_id. So the columns are under the \"columns\" key in row_data.\n\nSo, after parsing row_data, we have a dictionary with \"row_id\" and \"columns\". The selected columns are within the \"columns\" dictionary. So the final JSON should be the selected columns from that \"columns\" dict.\n\nTesting with the example: patient_id is \"P001\", diagnosis is \"NF1\". So the output JSON should be {\"patient_id\": \"P001\", \"diagnosis\": \"NF1\"}.\n\nI need to make sure that the values are correctly typed. For instance, if a column had a number, like age, it should be a number in the output. But in this case, the selected columns are strings. Also, if a value is null, it should remain null. But in the given data, there are no nulls.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. Parse row_data from JSON string to a Python dict.\n2. Parse selected_columns from JSON string to a list.\n3. For each column in selected_columns, get the value from row_data['columns'][column].\n4. Create a new dict with those key-value pairs, ensuring data types are preserved.\n5. Convert that dict to a JSON string in the required structure.\n\nIn Python, when converting to JSON, the json module will handle the data types, so integers stay as numbers, strings as strings, etc. So as long as the initial parsing is correct, the output should maintain the data types.\n\nSo applying this to the given input, the result should be the two selected columns with their respective values. The answer should be a JSON object with those keys and values.\n",

The selected_columns is also a JSON array string, so I need to parse that as well to get the list of column names the user is interested in.\n\nLooking at the example input, the row_data's columns are sample_id, assay, tumor_type, and date.

So the task is to take those three from the columns object.\n\nI need to make sure that the keys in the resulting JSON exactly match the selected columns, and the values are taken from the row_data's columns.

However, JSON objects are unordered, but when serialized, the order might be preserved depending on the implementation.

So, the user wants me to extract specific columns from a given row of data and return them in a JSON format. Let me start by understanding the input data.\n\nFirst, the input has \"row_data\" which is a JSON string. It contains a row_id and a columns object with location, temperature, and humidity. Then there's \"selected_columns\", which is a list of column names they want to retrieve: location, temperature, and humidity. The question is asking for the values of these columns for the first row.\n\nWait, the row_id here is 10, but the question mentions the first row. Maybe that's just a way of referring to the given row, regardless of its actual row_id. So I should focus on the columns in the row_data's columns object.\n\nI need to parse the row_data and selected_columns from their JSON string representations. The row_data is a string that needs to be parsed into a JSON object. Similarly, selected_columns is a string that's a JSON array. Once parsed, I can access the columns in the row_data and pick the ones listed in selected_columns.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Parse the row_data JSON string into an object. Let's see, the row_data has \"row_id\":10 and \"columns\" with the three keys. So after parsing, I can get the columns object.\n\n2. Parse the selected_columns JSON array string into an array. The selected columns are location, temperature, humidity.\n\n3. For each column in selected_columns, get the corresponding value from the columns object in row_data.\n\n4. Ensure that the data types are preserved. For example, temperature is 22.5 (a float), humidity is 45.0 (also a float), and location is a string \"Lab A\". So in the output JSON, these should be numbers and strings as they are, without quotes around numbers.\n\n5. Construct a JSON object with keys as the column names and values from the row_data. The output should look like:\n\n{\n  \"location\": \"Lab A\",\n  \"temperature\": 22.5,\n  \"humidity\": 45.0\n}\n\nI need to make sure there are no extra keys and that all selected columns are included. Also, check if any of the columns might be missing in the row_data, but in this case, all selected columns are present. If a column was missing, should I include it with null? But the problem says to extract the values for the selected columns, so perhaps assume they exist. But the problem statement says to maintain data types, including null. But in this case, all are present.\n\nSo the final JSON should have the three keys with their respective values, maintaining the data types. Let me double-check the input data to confirm. The row_data's columns have all three selected columns. So the answer is straightforward.\n",

                        "text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to extract specific columns from a given row of data and return them in a JSON format. Let me start by understanding the input data.\n\nFirst, the input has \"row_data\" which is a JSON string. It contains a row_id and a columns object with location, temperature, and humidity. Then there's \"selected_columns\", which is a list of column names they want to retrieve: location, temperature, and humidity. The question is asking for the values of these columns for the first row.\n\nWait, the row_id here is 10, but the question mentions the first row. Maybe that's just a way of referring to the given row, regardless of its actual row_id. So I should focus on the columns in the row_data's columns object.\n\nI need to parse the row_data and selected_columns from their JSON string representations. The row_data is a string that needs to be parsed into a JSON object. Similarly, selected_columns is a string that's a JSON array. Once parsed, I can access the columns in the row_data and pick the ones listed in selected_columns.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Parse the row_data JSON string into an object. Let's see, the row_data has \"row_id\":10 and \"columns\" with the three keys. So after parsing, I can get the columns object.\n\n2. Parse the selected_columns JSON array string into an array. The selected columns are location, temperature, humidity.\n\n3. For each column in selected_columns, get the corresponding value from the columns object in row_data.\n\n4. Ensure that the data types are preserved. For example, temperature is 22.5 (a float), humidity is 45.0 (also a float), and location is a string \"Lab A\". So in the output JSON, these should be numbers and strings as they are, without quotes around numbers.\n\n5. Construct a JSON object with keys as the column names and values from the row_data. The output should look like:\n\n{\n  \"location\": \"Lab A\",\n  \"temperature\": 22.5,\n  \"humidity\": 45.0\n}\n\nI need to make sure there are no extra keys and that all selected columns are included.
